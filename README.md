# Project Dog Breed Classification
This project was made as a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree.

## Description
In this project, a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images was made. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
There was realized pipeline to prepare and preprocess the data. The architecture of the model was designed and from scratch as well as tried  a transfer learning over VGG-16 pretrained model.
Finally, the was made an interface to pass an image to the predictor. The interface includes dog or face detector and dog breed classifier.
